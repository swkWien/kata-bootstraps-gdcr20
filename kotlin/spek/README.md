## Setup

    git clone https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps
    cd kotlin/spek
    gradle idea

Open the directory in Idea.


## Running Tests

To execute the tests run `gradle test` or run the tests from the IDE you are using (e.g. IntelliJ)

## Optimize Intellij Idea

by installing the spek plugin from Jetbrains


## Optimized for Usage of
